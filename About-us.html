<p>Hello my Name is<i> "IPSIT BHATT"</i> and i am from "UTTRAKHAND",Dehradun. I have completed my schooling from St Jude's school, Dehradun.<br>
Presently i am persuing Btech from DIT UNIVERSITY in computer science engineering with specialization in big data analytics. Well earlier when i opted for this course  in big data then i also don't knew much about it as i only wanted to opt for computer science engineering but whatever happened happened for good i opted for big data analytics finally. Big data is an enormous field in the computer science engineering and its demand will increase in the near future.<br>
Guys during my summer vacation i had just enjoyed alot and everyone does it the same mostly but ya this time i have something new for you all.<br>
This time in my vaccation whenever i had free time with me i just learned about developing websites and how to design them. It was a wonderfull experience learning website development and its a interesting task.Finally after  my hard labour i had been sucessfull in developing my own website for the very first time and i had found it very interesting.<br>
This time i had designed and developed a tuttorial on <strong>HTML language</strong> as i had learned about it in this project and then i had explained it further in my words for you all so that you all can also learn it.<br>
